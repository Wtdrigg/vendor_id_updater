# vendor_id_updater
This is a custom program used to automate a specific data entry task

This program uses Selenium and Chromedriver to update the vendor numbers of newly registered vendors in our risk tracking system to match the vendor number in our 
purchase order system.

It uses a basic GUI with 2 buttons, an entry box, a label, and progress bar. When the processing is completed the GUI buttons may be used to process again, or close
the program and Chromedriver.

Note that these two webpages are inaccessable without the correct chrome extension and login credentials saved to the chrome profile.
